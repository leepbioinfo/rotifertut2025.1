# This markdown has a summary of usefull syntax!

Markdown uses "#" to show headers, you add more "#" the header will get smaller

# This is title 1
## This is title 2
### This is title 3
#### This is title 4, if I'm not mistaken you can't go further than this (four "#")

# If you want to make a table

The table will have to follow by a "name column row", a row with dashes and your data

``` text
|Column 1 | Column 2 |
|---------|----------|
|Here1| Here2|
|Here3|Here4|
```

# You can link inside your markdown

The syntax would be a name in brackets, this will be what appears as blue, folowed by a parenthesis with the path to the file.

`[mylink]('.my/path/my/file.md)` or a web link!

[really cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) 

==friendly reminder== avoid clicking on rabdom links!

If you liked the highlight on the previous line, you can do this as `==your text==`

I don't know if github will render this, but in some markdown editors you can create  some divisions by adding multiple "-"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to make a block quote 

> like this

it's easy! just type the ">" followed by your text

# My markdown is broken oh no help

- Check if you have a newline between sessions, sometimes markdown breaks without it
- Identation! Sometimes it's your friend, sometimes is a foe
- Please feel free to update this tip markdown!

# Useful resoureces

I think that maybe it would be nice if I linked to a basics on github markdown and another one on the rotifer protocol?

Those do not exist.... yet!
